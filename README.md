# _printf
`_printf` is a re-implementation of the standard C library function printf. It provides a way to format and print data, similar to **printf**.

### Usage

```C
int _printf(const char *format, ...);
```

The `_printf` function takes in a format string, followed by any additional arguments specified in the format string. The format string consists of regular characters, which are simply printed, and conversion specifiers, which are replaced by the values of the corresponding arguments.
